## Personal Website
This is WIP Next.js project which serves a personal website and I also plan to make this a site with and index/description of my projects and blogs. This whole project is a flake.

> __NOTE:__ If you want to use any content provided inside the website such as images, videos or any other resources, you have to ask me for permission before listing it somewhere else. Post link to the content hosted on my github/website in these situations once you have my permission.
